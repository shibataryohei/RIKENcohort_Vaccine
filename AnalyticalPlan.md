# Analytical plan

# Aims
* Aim1: identify the temporal change of antibody data from 1Y to 7Y
* Aim2: identify the clinical factors that affected antibody data at 2Y and 7Y
* Aim3: identify the microbial factors that affected antibody data at 2Y and 7Y
* Aim4: examine the association of S.aureus colonization with antibody data

# Aim0
* Figure-M: scheme of the cohort
* Table-M: demographics (overall cohort vs. analytic cohort)

# Aim1
* Figure-M: pathplot (titer)
* Figure-M: alluvium plot (positive/negative for Hib)
* Table-S: relationship of the number of vaccination with antibody data

# Aim2
* Table-M: association of clinical factors with antibody data

# Aim3
* Figure-M: heatmap of microbial data and antibody data (Spearman's correlation)
  * Skin bacteria
  * Nasopharyngeal bacteria
  * Gut microbiota (alpha diversity)
* Figure-S: heatmap of gut microbiota and antibody data (Envfit)

# Aim4
* Table-M: association of S.aureus with antibody data
